# Futbol

[Turing School](https://turing.io/) Futbol project.

## Check-in Plan

- Check-ins will occur daily
- Planning for the next iteration will occur after previous iteration completion

## Project Plan

- Iteration Planning will occur as a team
  - Iteration features will be clearly known and agreed upon prior to iteration kickoff
  - features will be broken down into reasonable sub-functionalities
  - sub-functionality features will be available for anyone on the team to own and will be obtained from a kahnban board
- Iteration milestone and deliverables will be tracked in Github Projects

## Plan of Attack Considerations

- Studying the interaction pattern provides overview of functionality
- Studying the spec_harness should help drive spec dev

## Code Design

- StatTracker class will house all logic for
  - Game stats
  - League stats
  - Season stats
- After implementing full functionality, there may be opportunity for reusable calculations to be extracted into modules or superclasses; refactoring will be **post-hoc**
